            <h2>My name is Pam. I am a lover of happiness AND our eco-system.</h2>

            <div class="about-container">
                <p class="about-p"><strong>Like anyone else I am a consumer and love things to be convient. And that's
                        okay!</strong> It's making the right choices that matters.</p>
                <p>My green journey has been the most life changing experience that I wish I had done sooner. I love to
                    help others blossom in their journey.</p>

                <h3>>Simply Green</h3>
                <p class="about-p">Much like plants, you have to start from seed and then grow in to a beautiful healthy
                    tree. In the begining, I had so many things that I threw away with little thought of what happens to
                    them afterwards.</p>
                <p>Making the switch was very simple. It took a bit of time and understanding, which really just
                    enriches your mind. After you realize how you can still <a href="#">live a normal life and be
                        eco-friendly</a> it becomes second nature.</p>

                <h3>>Grow Together</h3>
                <p class="about-p">I became enlighted and cured myself of this weight of selfishness. Since going green,
                    the constant state of mindfulness has transformed me in to a more peaceful and happier person. <br>
                    Inside and out.
                    <strong>And you can too!</strong>
